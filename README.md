### Hi there 👋

I imagine myself as a math genie🧞‍♀️, here to guide students through the magical world of numbers and equations. My glasses aren't just for show🤓; they're my superpower lenses that help me see the world in angles and formulas. And yes, my long black hair has been known to occasionally obey the laws of gravity... or choose to defy them, depending on the day✨💃

My teaching style? Imagine if joy and rigor had a baby that loved to dance around in the realms of algebra and geometry. I'm here to prove that math isn't a beast to be tamed, but a friend to play with📚 🤗

So, gear up, dear students! Together, we're going to embark on an epic adventure where x's and y's aren't just letters, but treasures waiting to be discovered, and every problem solved is a dragon defeated🐉🏆

Who's ready to calculate some fun?🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️🔢
